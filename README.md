# Data Entry Job Automation
This is a program to automate the data entry work using Python Webscraping modules.

Technologies Used: Python, BeautifulSoup, Selenium Webdriver, API calls

1. Took the example of Zillion House Search Website. Based on certain conditions - Number of bedrooms, maximum rent etc, we make a call to the website.

2. We then scrape the result set from the site using Beautiful soup and Selenium
3. We create a google form with required questions. Our program fills out the form with all the entries present in website.
4. Using this we can export the form data to a google sheet to further data analysis.
